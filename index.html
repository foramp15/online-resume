        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Software Development Intern - Paycom, Inc. (May 2022 - Aug 2022)
                <ul>
                    <li>Collaborated closely with the CRM team to come up with an internal solution to scrape the information of the company's potential clients from various websites.
                    <li>Conducted research to determine the purpose, application and feasibility of our proposed solution.</li>
                    <li>Developed a web scraping engine using a NodeJS library - Puppeteer that scrapes data from various reliable websites.</li>
                    <li>Optimized our web scraping engine by incorporating parallelization that made our scrape run time reduced by 80% the original run time.</li>
                    <li>Designed the frontend UI landing page using ReactJS where users / stakeholders can filter their choices and run the scrape.</li>
                    <li>Used ExpressJS to connect our frontend with the web scrapers in the backend.</li>
                    <li>Utilized Gitlab for version control and JIRA for project management.</li>                      
                </ul>
            </li>
        <p>
            <li>Reseach Assistant - IDIR Lab (Oct 2022 - May 2023)
                <ul>
                    <li>Collaborate with three PhD students to develop a Twitter Data Collection Framework where I explicitly conduct research, gather user accounts and
                        tweets relating to health, and build a classifier.</li>
                    <li>The main goal is to propose a novel system that gathers recent data on a variety of hot topics, not just health, and to develop multiple techniques to
                        mitigate misinformation spread on social media.</li>
                </ul>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Garbage Detection using Object Detection techniques:
                <ul>
                    <li>Explored YOLO and trained YOLOv3 and YOLOv5 on a custom garbage image dataset (500 images) using GPU where the YOLOv5 model
                        achieved a very good mAP@50 value of 61.3%.</li>
                    <li>Customized YOLOv5 model to precisely locate the garbage from CCTV footage and images, and devised a framework using flask to notify the local
                        authorities via email.</li>
                    <li>Planned and produced a quality conference paper for ICAIS 2021 which is included in IEEE Xplore. Also, presented this paper at the
                        virtual conference.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Worked on the dataset containing 956 Chest X-ray images and trained various standard Deep Learning models like ResNet, Inception, AlexNet, etc
                        along with a customized CNN model on the GPU for the detection of COVID-19.</li>
                    <li>Collaborated with team members to perform hyperparameter tuning and attained best validation accuracy of 97.89%.</li>
                    <li>Co-authored a research paper on the same project topic which was accepted for an International Conference - ICCCMLA2020, Springer</li>
